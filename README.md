# QA Sprint 1 - Urban Routes

## 🛠️ Project Description
In this sprint, the focus was on **test design** and **test execution** for the **Urban Routes** application. The objective was to ensure that the route filtering system works correctly, displaying the appropriate routes based on city selection.

Test cases were created to validate the functionality of the route search based on cities, ensuring the feature works as expected.

## 🎯 Objective
Ensure that the system correctly returns available routes for selected cities, validating that the filter functionality is working properly and the routes are displayed as expected.
