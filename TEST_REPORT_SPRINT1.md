## üí° Final Analysis

During the functional tests for **Urban Routes Sprint 1**, 11 defects were identified, categorized as:

- 5 **High Priority**
- 6 **Medium Priority**

The system demonstrated good stability in basic navigation and layer switching (Relief, Satellite, Street View). However, recurring failures in the "From" and "To" fields, combined with missing map object icons, could severely impact user experience.

**Recommendation:** Address all high-priority issues before the next release to ensure a stable and reliable application for end users.
